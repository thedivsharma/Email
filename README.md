# LLM-Enabled Semantic Extraction and Autonomous Email Workflow Automation

An advanced NLP pipeline leveraging the OLLAMA LLM API , using the Gemma3 model to semantically parse unstructured email corpora and automate intelligent routing. Integrates transformer-based embeddings (Sentence-BERT), vector similarity search via FAISS, and schema-constrained generation to extract actionable entities and dynamically classify emails for seamless dispatch to relevant teams, enabling real-time workflow orchestration and eliminating manual intervention.
Enhanced with a preprocessing layer that applies Zero-Shot Classification to infer relevant data.
This context-aware enrichment boosts prompt relevance and significantly improves LLM output accuracy.
